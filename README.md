Week 4, homework 7 - Train Time

This project was an exercise to practice using Firebase to store and retrieve train schedule information, moment.js to manipuate date & time, and a little more styling by using Bootstrap again.    

The user can enter a train's name, destination, first departure time and interval between departures.  The app will store this information in the Firebase database and, upon retrieval, compare this information to the current time and display the next scheduled departure and the amount of time until that train leaves the station.
